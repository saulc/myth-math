That’s where the similarities between the two end. Rather than pistons, rods and crankshafts a rotary engine uses rotors spinning on an eccentric shaft. This effectively divides the oval-shaped rotor housing into four sections, each dedicated to one stage of the combustion cycle. Each section is sealed with an Apex seal located on each tip of the rotor.

Ask any rotary enthusiast and they will quickly cite a list of advantages this design has over the conventional, piston design. Most have proven to be true and are the reason why the rotary, despite being abandoned by car manufacturers, still has such a strong, cult following.
